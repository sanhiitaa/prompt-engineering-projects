# Ridge Regression Animation Project

As part of this prompt engineering project, I developed an engaging animation using the Manim Library to explain Ridge Regression and the impact of regularization in machine learning. I designed detailed prompts and guided visual elements, narrative flow, and technical aspects. With this input, ChatGPT assisted me by delivering well-written code, ensuring the animation effectively communicates concepts such as overfitting, the necessity of regularization, and the role of the lambda value in balancing model bias and complexity.
